# Sabesan Blockchain CA
This repo will contain all necessary files for blockchains CA project work. <br /> 

The project requirements and expectations are as follows, <br /> 

<b> Overview: </b> </br>
For the given blockchain assignment, an ERC20 token was deployed on the a Blockchain Ethereum test network, a code-based mechanism is deployed as docker image to perform basic token distributions for given ethereum addresses in the json data file. </br>

Following tasks were completed and related artefacts can be seen in mentioned respective locations

1. **Create an ERC20-compliant, fixed-supply token with the following parameters - This contract can be found inside contracts folder** <br /> 
2. **Deploy the token contract to the Ropsten/Rinkeby test network - <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xf6042a75d2834428f0d05a0aff8133d78fdaec0c"> link </a> to the deployed contract** <br /> 
3. **Build a Node.js application capable of accepting a file containing the following data - This scirpt can be found inside scripts folder and ethereum addresses should be listed in the location, data/ethereumAddresses.json** <br /> 
  
**Required Assignment Output:** <br /> 
    ● Address of contract on Ethereum Test Net <br /> 
        <b> <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xf6042a75d2834428f0d05a0aff8133d78fdaec0c"> Link </a> to the deployed contract </b>
